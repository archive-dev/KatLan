# KatLan
KatLan ([Katarine](https://github.com/whoisamyy/katarine) Language) is a JVM-compatible language that tries to make Java syntax less boilerplate.

# Building and Compiling

## Building

To build the compiler you need to have: 
1. Java 21 (recommended, didn't test on previous versions)
2. Gradle compatible with your java version (for java 21 the version is 8.6)

Command to build is: `gradlew compiler:build`

## Compiling code

To compile your KatLan code you need to run in your console:
   `java -jar <compiler-jar-name> filename.kat`

Output will be in the same folder as your jar and will have .class (JVM bytecode) extension.
