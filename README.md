# KatLan
KatLan ([Katarine](https://github.com/whoisamyy/katarine) Language) is a JVM-compatible language that tries to make Java syntax less boilerplate.

# Building and Compiling

## Building

To build the compiler, you need to have: 
1. Java 22 with preview features enabled or higher
2. Gradle 8.8+

Command to build is: `gradlew shadowJar`

## Compiling code

To compile your KatLan code, you need to run in your console:
   `java -jar <compiler-jar-name> filename.kat`

Output will be in the same folder as your jar and will have .class (JVM bytecode) extension.
